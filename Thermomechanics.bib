	abstract = {A new class of time-stepping algorithms for strongly coupled thermomechanical problems is presented which retains the computational convenience of traditional staggered algorithms without upsetting the unconditional stability property characteristic of fully implicit (monolithic) schemes. This class of methods was first introduced by the authors (in the general context of thermoplasticity) in the USCM held at Chicago, July 1991, and in the IUTAM symposium held at Hannover, Germany, September 1991 The proposed schemes are fractional step methods associated with a two phase operator split of the full non-linear system of thermoelasticity into an adiabatic elastodynamics phase, followed by a heat conduction phase at fixed configuration. This operator split is shown to inherit the contractivity property of the full problem of evolution, thus leading to unconditionally B-stable product formula algorithms. In sharp contrast with this stability result, traditional staggered algorithms based on an isothermal mechanical phase followed by a heat conduction phase with an effective heat source are shown to lead, at best, to conditionally stable schemes. It is further shown that the actual implementation of these two classes of schemes is essentially identical. The numerical simulations presented include both dynamic and quasi-static problems and are shown to closely replicate the stability estimates and non-linear stability results derived for these two classes of staggered schemes.},

The key computational implication is this: the closest-point-projection algorithm of any classical simple-surface or multi-surface model of infinitesimal plasticity carries over to the present finite deformation context without modification. In particular, the algorithmic elastoplastic tangent moduli of the infinitesimal theory remain unchanged. For the static problem, the proposed class of algorithms preserve exactly plastic volume changes if the yield criterion is pressure insensitive. For the dynamic problem, a class of time-stepping algorithms is presented which inherits exactly the conservation laws of total linear and angular momentum.

	abstract = {In simulations of contact/impact phenomena using finite element techniques, spurious oscillations and /or numerical instabilities continue to pose considerable difficulty for many analysts. Recently, the combination of thermodynamically based stability estimates and energy-momentum numerical approaches has proven to be useful in developing effective, unconditionally stable algorithms for mechanical contact/impact in the fully nonlinear regime. In this paper, these ideas are extended to coupled interface problems, by developing a new a priori stability estimate for the fully coupled thermomechanical contact problem in large deformations. The model framework encompasses inelastic heating and thermal softening within the contacting bodies, as well as frictional heating and thermal softening of the coefficient of friction on sliding interfaces. Also incorporated are pressure dependent heat transfer across these interfaces, and a fully coupled treatment of the conductive heat transfer occurring within the bodies. Use of the stability estimate to extend energy-momentum approaches to dissipative and thermally coupled phenomena is discussed, as is the development of an unconditionally stable adiabatic split of the coupled problem. The latter is shown to be useful in developing partitioned integration schemes for the coupled equations of evolution.},

	abstract = {This work describes the formulation adopted for the numerical simulation of the friction stir welding (FSW) process. FSW is a solid-state joining process (the metal is not melted during the process) devised for applications where the original metallurgical characteristics must be retained. This process is primarily used on aluminum alloys, and most often on large pieces which cannot be easily heat treated to recover temper characteristics. Heat is either induced by the friction between the tool shoulder and the work pieces or generated by the mechanical mixing (stirring and forging) process without reaching the melting point (solid-state process). To simulate this kind of welding process, a fully coupled thermo-mechanical solution is adopted. A sliding mesh, rotating together with the pin (ALE formulation), is used to avoid the extremely large distortions of the mesh around the tool in the so called stirring zone while the rest of the mesh of the sheet is fixed (Eulerian formulation). The orthogonal subgrid scale (OSS) technique is used to stabilize the mixed velocity{\textendash}pressure formulation adopted to solve the Stokes problem. This stabilized formulation can deal with the incompressible behavior of the material allowing for equal linear interpolation for both the velocity and the pressure fields. The material behavior is characterized either by Norton{\textendash}Hoff or Sheppard{\textendash}Wright rigid thermo-visco-plastic constitutive models. Both the frictional heating due to the contact interaction between the surface of the tool and the sheet, and the heat induced by the visco-plastic dissipation of the stirring material have been taken into account. Heat convection and heat radiation models are used to dissipate the heat through the boundaries. Both the streamline-upwind/Petrov{\textendash}Galerkin (SUPG) formulation and the OSS stabilization technique have been implemented to stabilize the convective term in the balance of energy equation. The numerical simulations presented are intended to show the accuracy of the proposed methodology and its capability to study real FSW processes where a non-circular pin is often used.},

Some fundamental properties of redundant natural coordinate systems of reference are studied, and the local description of the coupled thermomechanical problem is developed a priori in natural terms. Following the transition from the local to the finite element level the numerical solution of the equations governing the coupled thermomechanical problem for the discretised body undergoing finite inelastic deformations is discussed. A number of applications conclude the paper. First a purely thermal problem is investigated which is followed by the study of various physical effects on the thermomechanical response of an expanding hollow cylinder assuming plastic and viscoplastic inelastic properties of the material. Two examples taken from the metal forming practice - the heading of a steel bolt and the extrusion of an aluminium billet - are treated under the aspect of thermomechanical coupling.

	abstract = {Multibody contact problems are common within the field of multiphysics simulation. Applications involving thermomechanical contact scenarios are also quite prevalent. Such problems can be challenging to solve due to the likelihood of thermal expansion affecting contact geometry which, in turn, can change the thermal behavior of the components being analyzed. This paper explores a simple model of a light water reactor nuclear fuel rod, which consists of cylindrical pellets of uranium dioxide (UO2) fuel sealed within a Zircalloy cladding tube. The tube is initially filled with helium gas, which fills the gap between the pellets and cladding tube. The accurate modeling of heat transfer across the gap between fuel pellets and the protective cladding is essential to understanding fuel performance, including cladding stress and behavior under irradiated conditions, which are factors that affect the lifetime of the fuel. The thermomechanical contact approach developed here is based on the mortar finite element method, where Lagrange multipliers are used to enforce weak continuity constraints at participating interfaces. In this formulation, the heat equation couples to linear mechanics through a thermal expansion term. Lagrange multipliers are used to formulate the continuity constraints for both heat flux and interface traction at contact interfaces. The resulting system of nonlinear algebraic equations are cast in residual form for solution of the transient problem. A Jacobian-free Newton Krylov method is used to provide for fully-coupled solution of the coupled thermal contact and heat equations.},

Emphasis is placed on the proper numerical description of fully coupled thermomechanical response on frictional interfaces. From a theoretical standpoint, the first and second laws of thermodynamics are carefully formulated in the context of large deformations, giving rise to a numerical description of contact interaction that is consistent with these laws. Physical observations encompassed by the proposed interface description include thermal softening of frictional response, rate dependence, pressure dependent heat conduction across the interface, and heat sinks on the interfaces created by trapped wear debris. The finite element implementation of the framework is discussed and demonstrated, with numerical examples successfully describing such phenomena as fading braking torque in automobiles and the observed temperature and friction evolution at the interface between a gun barrel and a projectile passing through it. {\textcopyright} 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

One important example treated here is fluid{\textendash}structure interaction (FSI). Often procedures or even software exists to solve each sub-problem separately, and one wants to couple both. This setting seems to allow only the so-called weak coupling which is not sufficient for some problems. The so-called strong coupling is often a totally implicit formulation, where the system components are evaluated at the same time level. This usually requires an iterative procedure. The FSI problem is cast as an abstract differential algebraic equation (DAE), for which the coupling procedures are developed. With the partitioned approach, one simple and frequently used computational procedure is similar to a block-Gauss{\textendash}Seidel iteration. It is shown why this approach may experience difficulties, and how they may be circumvented with Newton-like methods still staying in the partitioned framework. The functional and software engineering requirements for the simulation interface are described and analysed. Some simple coupled example problems demonstrate how the proposed procedures work.},

	abstract = {A recent experiment confirmed that the infrared (IR) local heating method drastically reduces springback of dual-phase (DP) 980 sheets. In the experiment, only the plastic deformation zone of the sheets was locally heated using condensed IR heating. The heated sheets were then deformed by V-bending or 2D-draw bending. Although the experimental observation proved the merit of using the IR local heating to reduce springback, numerical modeling has not been reported. Numerical modeling has been required to predict springback and improve the understanding of the forming process. This paper presents a numerical modeling for V-bending and 2D-draw bending of DP 980 sheets exposed to the IR local heating with the finite element method (FEM). For describing the thermo-mechanical behavior of the DP 980 sheet, a flow stress model which includes a function of temperature and effective plastic strain was newly implemented into Euler-backward stress integration method. The numerical analysis shows that the IR local heating reduces the level of stress in the deformation zone, although it heats only the limited areas, and then it reduces the springback. The simulation also provides a support that the local heating method has an advantage of shape accuracy over the method to heat the material as a whole in V-bending. The simulated results of the springback in both V-bending and 2D-draw bending also show good predictions.},

	abstract = {Many problems of interest, particularly in the nuclear engineering field, involve coupling between the thermal and mechanical response of an engineered system. The strength of the two-way feedback between the thermal and mechanical solution fields can vary significantly depending on the problem. Contact problems exhibit a particularly high degree of two-way feedback between those fields. This paper describes and demonstrates the application of a flexible simulation environment that permits the solution of coupled physics problems using either a tightly coupled approach or a loosely coupled approach. In the tight coupling approach, Newton iterations include the coupling effects between all physics, while in the loosely coupled approach, the individual physics models are solved independently, and fixed-point iterations are performed until the coupled system is converged. These approaches are applied to simple demonstration problems and to realistic nuclear engineering applications. The demonstration problems consist of single and multi-domain thermomechanics with and without thermal and mechanical contact. Simulations of a reactor pressure vessel under pressurized thermal shock conditions and a simulation of light water reactor fuel are also presented. Problems that include thermal and mechanical contact, such as the contact between the fuel and cladding in the fuel simulation, exhibit much stronger two-way feedback between the thermal and mechanical solutions, and as a result, are better solved using a tight coupling strategy.},

The proposed strategy is based on the isothermal split methodology, i.e. the mechanical problem is solved at constant temperature and the thermal problem is solved for a fixed configuration. Nevertheless,the procedure for this strategy is divided into two phases within each increment: the prediction and the correction phases, while the interchange of information is performed on both. This allows takingadvantage of automatic time-step control techniques, previously implemented for the mechanicalproblem, which is the main feature that distinguishes it from the classical strategies. The aim of the proposed strategy is to reduce the computational cost without compromising the accuracy of the results. The new coupling strategy is validated using three numerical examples, comparing its accuracy and performance with the ones obtained with the classical (commonly employed) strategies for solving thermomechanical problems. Moreover, the influence of the time-step size on the accuracy is analysed. The results indicate that the proposed strategy presents accuracy close to the one obtained with the implicit coupling algorithm, while the computational cost is only slightly higher than the one required by the explicit strategy.},

The model is presented in the context of a convected reference frame, which preserves frame indifference and is highly amenable to numerical implementation. The model features a state variable approach to the quantification of steady state sliding, and a Perzyna viscoplastic regularization which introduces the viscous frictional behavior often observed in response to rapid slip rate changes. Numerical aspects of implementing the model in a finite element architecture are discussed. Through a series of simple slider and large deformation finite element simulations, the capability of the model to reasonably predict rate-dependent sliding behavior is demonstrated.},

In contrast to staggered algorithms, a monolithic approach, which solves the mechanical as well as the thermal part simultaneously, is introduced. The approach is thermodynamically consistent in the sense that the first law of thermodynamics is fulfilled. Furthermore, a domain decomposition method for the thermoelastic system is developed based on previous developments in the context of the mortar method.

Although mortar methods are well analyzed for variational inequalities, its application to dynamic thermo-mechanical contact problems with friction is still a field of active research. In this work, we extend the mortar approach for dynamic contact problems with Coulomb friction to the thermo-mechanical case. We focus on the discretization and on algorithmic aspects of dynamic effects such as frictional heating and thermal softening at the contact interface. More precisely, we generalize the mortar concept of dual Lagrange multipliers to non-linear Robin-type interface conditions and apply local static condensation to eliminate the heat flux. Numerical examples in the two-dimensional and the three-dimensional setting illustrate the flexibility of the discretization on non-matching meshes.},

The independent choice of time integration schemes is achieved by temporal consistent interpolation of the interface traction. To reduce computational costs, we introduce the possibility of field specific predictors in both structure and fluid field. These predictors act on the single fields only. Possible violations of the interface coupling conditions during the predictor step are dealt with within the monolithic solution procedure. We present full details of such a generalized monolithic solution procedure, which is fully consistent in its nonconforming temporal and spatial discretization. The incorporated mortar approach allows for nonmatching spatial discretizations of the fluid and solid domain at the fluid-structure interface and is fully integrated in the resulting monolithic system of equations. The method is applied to a variety of numerical examples. Thereby, temporal convergence rates, the special role of essential boundary conditions at the fluid-structure interface, and the positive effect of predictors are demonstrated and discussed. Emphasis is put on the comparison of different time integration schemes in fluid and structure field, for what the achieved freedom of choice of time integrators is fully exploited.},

Existing physics-based block preconditioners have proven to be efficient, but their error assessment reveals an accumulation of the error at the coupling surface. We address this issue by combining them with an additional additive Schwarz preconditioner, whose subdomains span across the interface on purpose. By performing cheap but accurate subdomain solves that do not depend on the separation of physical fields, this error accumulation can be reduced effectively. Numerical experiments compare the performance of the hybrid preconditioner to existing approaches, demonstrate the increased efficiency, and study its parallel performance.},

To be able to deal with non-conforming meshes at the fluid{\textendash}structure interface, we propose the integration of a dual mortar method into the general FSI framework. This method has lately been used successfully to impose interface constraints in other contexts such as finite deformation contact. The main focus is set on monolithic coupling algorithms for FSI here. In these cases the dual mortar approach allows for the elimination of the additional Lagrange multiplier degrees of freedom from the global system by condensation. The resulting system matrices have the same block structure as their counterparts for the conforming case and permit the same numerical treatment. Partitioned Dirichlet{\textendash}Neumann coupling is also considered briefly and it is shown that the dual mortar approach permits a numerically efficient mapping between fluid and structure quantities at the interface. Numerical examples demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method. We present results for a variety of different element formulations for the fluid and the structure field, indicating that the proposed method is not limited to any specific formulation.

These results are shown to hold for general models of multiplicative plasticity that include, as a particular case, the single-crystal model. The proposed product formula algorithm is designed via an entropy based operator split that yields one of the first known staggered algorithms that retains the property of nonlinear unconditional stability. The scheme employs an isentropic step, in which the total entropy is held constant, followed by a heat conduction step (with nonlinear source) at fixed configuration. The nonlinear stability analysis shows that the proposed staggered scheme inherits the a priori energy estimate for the continuum problem, regardless of the size of the time-step. In sharp contrast with these results, it is shown that widely used staggered methods employing an isothermal step followed by a heat conduction problem can be at most only conditionally stable.

The final goal is to get an accurate, efficient and robust numerical model, allowing the numerical simulation of solidification processes in the metal casting industry. Some of the current issues addressed in the paper are the following. A fractional step method arising from an operator split of the governing differential equations has been used to solve the nonlinear coupled system of equations, leading to a staggered product formula solution algorithm. Nonlinear stability issues are discussed and isentropic and isothermal operator splits are formulated. Within the isentropic split, a strong operator split design constraint is introduced, by requiring that the elastic and plastic entropy, as well as the phase-change induced elastic entropy due to the latent heat, remain fixed in the mechanical problem. The formulation of the model has been consistently derived within a thermodynamic framework. The constitutive behavior has been defined by a thermoelastoplastic free energy function, including a thermal multiphase change contribution. Plastic response has been modeled by a J2 temperature dependent model, including plastic hardening and thermal softening. A brief summary of the thermomechanical frictional contact model is included. The numerical model has been implemented into the computational Finite Element code COMET developed by the authors. A numerical assessment of the isentropic and isothermal operator splits, regarding the nonlinear stability behavior, has been performed for weakly and strongly coupled thermomechanical problems. Numerical simulations of solidification processes show the performance of the computational model developed.},

Exact linearizations for the calculation of the tangent stiffness are performed in each of these solution steps. A fully implicit, thermo-mechanically coupled and incrementally objective Euler-backward radial return based map is developed for the time integration of the constitutive equations. The present model is used to analyse a number of benchmark examples including metal forming processes wherein temperature and the accumulated damage play an important role in influencing the deformation mechanism and the nature of the deformed workpiece.

	abstract = {The paper outlines a constitutive model for finite thermo-visco-plastic behavior of amorphous glassy polymers and considers details of its numerical implementation. In contrast to existing kinematical approaches to finite plasticity of glassy polymers, the formulation applies a plastic metric theory based on an additive split of Lagrangian Hencky-type strains into elastic and plastic parts. The analogy between the proposed formulation in the logarithmic strain space and the geometrically linear theory of plasticity, makes this constitutive framework very transparent and attractive with regard to its numerical formulation. The characteristic strain hardening of the model is derived from a polymer network model. We consider the particularly simple eight chain model, but also comment on the recently developed microsphere model. The viscoplastic flow rule in the logarithmic strain space uses structures of the free volume flow theory, which provides a highly predictive modeling capacity at the onset of viscoplastic flow. The integration of this micromechanically motivated approach into a three-dimensional computational model is a key concern of this work. We outline details of the numerical implementation of this model, including elements such as geometric pre- and post-transformations to/from the logarithmic strain space, a thermomechanical operator split algorithm consisting of an isothermal mechanical predictor followed by a heat conduction corrector and finally, the consistent linearization of the local update algorithm for the dissipative variables as well as its relationship to the global tangent operator. The performance of the proposed formulation is demonstrated by means of a spectrum of numerical examples, which we compare with our experimental findings.},

Novel aspects are a direct representation of the Eulerian thermoelastic moduli in terms of the Finger tensor and a rigorous decomposition of the thermoelastic response functions into decoupled volumetric and isochoric contributions based on a multiplicative split of the Finger tensor into spherical and unimodular parts. An algorithmic procedure for the computation of the stress and thermoelastic moduli, based on a representation of the free energy in terms of eigenvalues of the unimodular part of the Finger tensor, is developed and applied to model problems of strictly entropic and modified entropic thermoelasticity. Furthermore, two algorithms for the solution of the coupled problem are discussed, based on operator splits of the global field equations of thermoelasticity.

	abstract = {Coupled-field dynamic problems in mechanics have been traditionally solved by treating the entire system as one computational entity. More recently, increasing attention has been directed to an alternative approach; partition the governing equations into subsystems, which are treated by subsystem analyzers. The selection of the subsystems may be based on weak-coupling considerations, widely different time response characteristics, isolation of nonlinear effects, or more pragmatic reasons such as the availability of analyzer software. In a staggered solution procedure the solution state of the coupled system is advanced by sequentially executing the subsystem analyzers. Subsystem coupling terms are accounted for by temporal extrapolation techniques. This paper focuses on the formulation and computer implementation of staggered solution procedures for two-field problems governed by semidiscrete second-order coupled differential equations. Such equations find application in the modeling of structure-fluid, structure-soil and structure-structure interaction. Following an introductory description of candidate problems and general solution strategies, direct time integration methods are formulated and applied to the coupled system. Staggered solution procedures are constructed through two alternative approaches which are based upon partitioning at the difference and differential equation level, respectively. Characteristic equations that govern the stability of the resulting implementations are derived, and the selection of stable extrapolators discussed. Finally, possible extensions of staggered solution procedures to coupled-field static and eigenvalue problems are suggested.},

In addition, the field quantities of interest need to be transferred between the solvers. To this end, we developed the software framework comana, which facilitates the implementation of different coupling strategies for a vast range of multifield problems.

	abstract = {The thermally coupled incompressible inductionless magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) problem models the flow of an electrically charged fluid under the influence of an external electromagnetic field with thermal coupling. This system of partial differential equations is strongly coupled and highly nonlinear for real cases of interest. Therefore, fully implicit time integration schemes are very desirable in order to capture the different physical scales of the problem at hand. However, solving the multiphysics linear systems of equations resulting from such algorithms is a very challenging task which requires efficient and scalable preconditioners. In this work, a new family of recursive block LU preconditioners is designed and tested for solving the thermally coupled inductionless MHD equations. These preconditioners are obtained after splitting the fully coupled matrix into one-physics problems for every variable (velocity, pressure, current density, electric potential and temperature) that can be optimally solved, e.g., using preconditioned domain decomposition algorithms. The main idea is to arrange the original matrix into an (arbitrary) 2{\texttimes}2 block matrix, and consider an LU preconditioner obtained by approximating the corresponding Schur complement. For every one of the diagonal blocks in the LU preconditioner, if it involves more than one type of unknowns, we proceed the same way in a recursive fashion. This approach is stated in an abstract way, and can be straightforwardly applied to other multiphysics problems. Further, we precisely explain a flexible and general software design for the code implementation of this type of preconditioners.},

	abstract = {The coupling of flexible structures to incompressible fluids draws a lot of attention during the last decade. Many different solution schemes have been proposed. In this contribution, we concentrate on the strong coupling fluid{\textendash}structure interaction by means of monolithic solution schemes. Therein, a Newton{\textendash}Krylov method is applied to the monolithic set of nonlinear equations. Such schemes require good preconditioning to be efficient. We propose two preconditioners that apply algebraic multigrid techniques to the entire fluid{\textendash}structure interaction system of equations. The first is based on a standard block Gauss{\textendash}Seidel approach, where approximate inverses of the individual field blocks are based on a algebraic multigrid hierarchy tailored for the type of the underlying physical problem. The second is based on a monolithic coarsening scheme for the coupled system that makes use of prolongation and restriction projections constructed for the individual fields. The resulting nonsymmetric monolithic algebraic multigrid method therefore involves coupling of the fields on coarse approximations to the problem yielding significantly enhanced performance.

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose and evaluate the performance of a unified computational framework for preconditioning systems of linear equations resulting from the solution of coupled problems with monolithic schemes. The framework is composed by promising application-specific preconditioners presented previously in the literature with the common feature that they are able to be implemented for a generic coupled problem, involving an arbitrary number of fields, and to be used to solve a variety of applications. The first selected preconditioner is based on a generic block Gauss{\textendash}Seidel iteration for uncoupling the fields, and standard algebraic multigrid (AMG) methods for solving the resulting uncoupled problems. The second preconditioner is based on the semi-implicit method for pressure-linked equations (SIMPLE) which is extended here to deal with an arbitrary number of fields, and also results in uncoupled problems that can be solved with standard AMG. Finally, a more sophisticated preconditioner is considered which enforces the coupling at all AMG levels, in contrast to the other two techniques which resolve the coupling only at the finest level. Our purpose is to show that these methods perform satisfactory in quite different scenarios apart from their original applications. To this end, we consider three very different coupled problems: thermo-structure interaction, fluid{\textendash}structure interaction and a complex model of the human lung. Numerical results show that these general purpose methods are efficient and scalable in this range of applications.},

	abstract = {A formulation of isotropic thermoplasticity for arbitrary large elastic and plastic strains is presented. The underlying concept is the introduction of a metric transformation tensor which maps a locally defined six-dimensional plastic metric onto the metric of the current configuration. This mixed-variant tensor field provides a basis for the definition of a local isotropic hyperelastic stress response in the thermoplastic solid. Following this fundamental assumption, we derive a consistent internal variable formulation of thermoplasticity in a Lagrangian as well as a Eulerian geometric setting. On the numerical side, we discuss in detail an objective integration algorithm for the mixed-variant plastic flow rule. The special feature here is a new representation of the stress return and the algorithmic elastoplastic moduli in the eigenvalue space of the Eulerian plastic metric for plane problems. Furthermore, an algorithm for the solution of the coupled problem is formulated based on an operator split of the global field equations of thermoplasticity. The paper concludes with two representative numerical simulations of thermoplastic deformation processes.},

The coupled thermo-mechanical boundary-value problem under consideration consists of the equilibrium problem for a deformable, inelastic and dissipative solid with the heat conduction problem appended in addition. The variational formulation allows for general dissipative solids, including finite elastic and plastic deformations, non-Newtonian viscosity, rate sensitivity, arbitrary flow and hardening rules, as well as heat conduction. We show that a joint potential function exists such that both the conservation of energy and the balance of linear momentum equations follow as Euler{\textendash}Lagrange equations. The identification of the joint potential requires a careful distinction between equilibrium and external temperatures, which are equal at equilibrium. The variational framework predicts the fraction of dissipated energy that is converted to heat. A comparison of this prediction and experimental data suggests that $\alpha$-titanium and Al2024-T conform to the variational framework.},

The underlying equations are based on the non-linear transient heat equation, the local equilibrium conditions and the evolution equations of the internal variables. The latter describe the hardening behavior of the material. If the method of vertical lines is applied, its first step{\textendash}namely the spatial discretization{\textendash}yields a system of differential-algebraic equations (DAE-system). Here, we employ the p-version of the finite element method based on integrated Legendre polynomials. This can lead to very precise solutions in the spatial domain. In order to be accurate in the time-domain as well, stiffly accurate, diagonally-implicit Runge{\textendash}Kutta methods are applied to solve the DAE-system yielding a coupled system of non-linear algebraic equations. In this article, the system is solved monolithically by employing the Multilevel-Newton algorithm. Accordingly, a high-order result is obtained in the space and the time domain. The numerical concept is applied to a constitutive model of finite strain thermo-viscoelasticity. Several examples are applied to demonstrate the efficiency and applicability of the numerical scheme. It is especially the transient problems that call for time-adaptive schemes which are naturally embedded in the concept.},

The structure is represented by means of an appropriate standard finite element formulation. For the temporal discretisation of both fluid and solid bodies, the discrete implicit generalised-$\alpha$ method is employed. An important aspect of the presented work is the introduction of the independent interface discretisation, which allows an efficient, modular and expandable implementation of the solution strategy. A simple data transfer strategy based on a finite element type interpolation of the interface degrees of freedom guarantees kinematic consistency and equilibrium of the stresses along the interface. The resulting strongly coupled set of non-linear equations is solved by means of a novel partitioned solution procedure, which is based on the Newton{\textendash}Raphson methodology and incorporates the full linearisation of the overall incremental problem. Thus, asymptotically quadratic convergence of the residuals is achieved. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the methodology.},

In fact this is the only method by which Nonlinear Solid Mechanics is utilized in engineering practice. The book opens with a fundamental chapter on vectors and tensors. The following chapters are based on nonlinear continuum mechanics - an inevitable prerequisite for computational mechanicians. In addition, continuum field theory (applied to a representative sample of hyperelastic materials currently used in nonlinear computations such as incompressible and compressible materials) is presented, as are transversely isotropic materials, composite materials, viscoelastic materials and hyperelastic materials with isotropic damage. Another central chapter is devoted to the thermodynamics of materials, covering both finite thermoelasticity and finite thermoviscoelasticity. Also included are:* an up-to-date list of almost 300 references and a comprehensive index* useful examples and exercises for the student* selected topics of statistical and continuum thermodynamics.Furthermore, the principle of virtual work (in both the material and spatial descriptions) is compared with two and three-field variational principles particularly designed to capture kinematic constraints such as incompressibility. All of the features combined result in an essential text for final year undergraduates, postgraduates and researchers in mechanical, civil and aerospace engineering and applied maths and physics.},

Though saturation was not fully reached even with twisted rods, curves representing the experimental results for copper indicate that it would have been reached at a plastic strain very little greater than the strain at fracture. The amount of cold work necessary to saturate copper with latent energy at 15{\textdegree} C. is thus found to be slightly greater than 14 calories per gram. By using compression instead of torsion, it was found possible to do much more cold work on copper than this, and compression tests revealed the fact that the compressive stress increases with increasing strain till the total applied cold work was equivalent to 15 calories per gram. No further rise in compressive stress occurred with further compression even though the specimen was compressed till its height was only 1/53rd of its original height.},

	abstract = {SUMMARYIn the present work, a monolithic solution approach for thermo-structure interaction problems motivated by the challenging application of the behaviour of rocket nozzles is proposed. Structural and thermal fields are independently discretised via finite elements. The resulting system of equations is solved via a monolithic thermo-structure interaction scheme, which is constructed by a block Gauss{\textendash}Seidel preconditioner in combination with algebraic multigrid methods. The proposed method is tested for four numerical examples, the second Danilovskaya problem, a simplified rocket nozzle configuration, an internally loaded hollow sphere, and a fully three-dimensional nozzle configuration of a subscale thrust chamber. Good agreement of the numerical results with results from the literature is observed. Furthermore, it is shown that the monolithic solution algorithm can handle the complete range of the parameter spectrum, whereas partitioned algorithms are limited to a certain parameter range only. Moreover, the monolithic algorithm exhibits improved efficiency and robustness compared to partitioned algorithms. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

First, we develop the entire system of differential{\textendash}algebraic equations resulting from the spatially discretized principle of virtual displacements, the principle of virtual temperatures, and the evolution equations of the internal variables provided by the constitutive model. In the time-integration step this system is solved both using a fully monolithic approach based on a Backward{\textendash}Euler scheme in combination with the Multilevel-Newton algorithm as well as a partitioned approach solving the fully coupled system. The latter is treated by means of a combination of a Backward{\textendash}Euler method and an accelerated Gauss{\textendash}Seidel/Multilevel-Newton scheme to solve the resulting system of algebraic equations within each time-integration step. Additionally, we consider a specific treatment of the interpolation between different meshes within the partitioned approach. This is shown for p-version finite elements based on hierarchical shape functions. Finally, it turns out that the specific constitutive model of small-strain thermo-viscoplasticity, which is based on the decomposition into kinematic hardening and energy storing strains, yields a problem-adapted stress algorithm. This allows to reduce the stress algorithm on Gauss-point level to the solution of one scalar equation. Numerical examples serve to elucidate the behavior and properties of the proposed methods.},

	abstract = {Incremental sheet forming is an advanced manufacturing technique where a piece of sheet is shaped into a product by a series of small incremental localized deformations. It has revolutionized sheet shaping for small-batch production since its inception in the 1990s, providing an economical and effective alternative to sheet stamping and pressing, which are cumbersome and expensive. However, the materials with poor overall ductility at room temperatures are difficult to be formed by conventional incremental sheet forming. Therefore, several heat-assisted incremental sheet-forming methods have been developed by researchers trying to improve the formability of such materials and overcome the low geometrical accuracy as well. The aim of this paper is to provide a state-of-the-art review on the development of heat-assisted incremental sheet forming. It is hoped that the knowledge provided in this paper can facilitate readers working in this field to obtain a comprehensive view and take a step forward for future incremental forming of hard-to-deform materials at elevated temperatures.},

The use of the finite element method (FEM) in this regard has been especially popular because of its flexibility and the ability to quantify stress levels for a large variety of scenarios ranging from process-induced stress up to field conditions. The thermo-mechanical behaviour of the module or its components is often considered due to the link with common field failures such as cell cracks, interconnection failures, glass fracture, delamination and many others. However, the approaches used, the various inputs considered and the obtained results are highly scattered and sometimes conflicting. This work provides a structured review of the reported simulation approaches and resulting insights obtained through thermo-mechanical finite element simulations on commercial as well as novel PV module technologies. The influence and validity of various inputs such as the used material models, boundary conditions and other assumptions are discussed.

	abstract = {This paper deals with the numerical simulation of friction stir welding (FSW) processes. FSW techniques are used in many industrial applications and particularly in the aeronautic and aerospace industries, where the quality of the joining is of essential importance. The analysis is focused either at global level, considering the full component to be jointed, or locally, studying more in detail the heat affected zone (HAZ). The analysis at global (structural component) level is performed defining the problem in the Lagrangian setting while, at local level, an apropos kinematic framework which makes use of an efficient combination of Lagrangian (pin), Eulerian (metal sheet) and ALE (stirring zone) descriptions for the different computational sub-domains is introduced for the numerical modeling. As a result, the analysis can deal with complex (non-cylindrical) pin-shapes and the extremely large deformation of the material at the HAZ without requiring any remeshing or remapping tools. A fully coupled thermo-mechanical framework is proposed for the computational modeling of the FSW processes proposed both at local and global level. A staggered algorithm based on an isothermal fractional step method is introduced. To account for the isochoric behavior of the material when the temperature range is close to the melting point or due to the predominant deviatoric deformations induced by the visco-plastic response, a mixed finite element technology is introduced. The Variational Multi Scale method is used to circumvent the LBB stability condition allowing the use of linear/linear P1/P1 interpolations for displacement (or velocity, ALE/Eulerian formulation) and pressure fields, respectively. The same stabilization strategy is adopted to tackle the instabilities of the temperature field, inherent characteristic of convective dominated problems (thermal analysis in ALE/Eulerian kinematic framework). At global level, the material behavior is characterized by a thermo{\textendash}elasto{\textendash}viscoplastic constitutive model. The analysis at local level is characterized by a rigid thermo{\textendash}visco-plastic constitutive model. Different thermally coupled (non-Newtonian) fluid-like models as Norton{\textendash}Hoff, Carreau or Sheppard{\textendash}Wright, among others are tested. To better understand the material flow pattern in the stirring zone, a (Lagrangian based) particle tracing is carried out while post-processing FSW results. A coupling strategy between the analysis of the process zone nearby the pin-tool (local level analysis) and the simulation carried out for the entire structure to be welded (global level analysis) is implemented to accurately predict the temperature histories and, thereby, the residual stresses in FSW.},

Residual stresses can be highly detrimental as they can lead to creeping, fatigue, and stress corrosion cracking. The final state of residual stresses in a workpiece depends on its material as well as the cutting-tool configuration such as tool geometry/coating, cooling and wear conditions, and process parameters including the cutting speed, depth-of-cut and feed-rate. However, there have been disagreements in some literatures regarding influences of the above-mentioned factors on residual stresses due to different cutting conditions, tool parameters and workpiece materials used in the specific investigations. This review paper categorizes different methods in experimental, numerical and analytical approaches employed for determining induced residual stresses and their relationships with cutting conditions in a turning process.

	abstract = {A comprehensive computational framework based on the finite element method for the simulation of coupled hygro-thermo-mechanical problems in photovoltaic laminates is herein proposed. While the thermo-mechanical problem takes place in the three-dimensional space of the laminate, moisture diffusion occurs in a two-dimensional domain represented by the polymeric layers and by the vertical channel cracks in the solar cells. Therefore, a geometrical multi-scale solution strategy is pursued by solving the partial differential equations governing heat transfer and thermo-elasticity in the three-dimensional space, and the partial differential equation for moisture diffusion in the two dimensional domains. By exploiting a staggered scheme, the thermo-mechanical problem is solved first via a fully implicit solution scheme in space and time, with a specific treatment of the polymeric layers as zero-thickness interfaces whose constitutive response is governed by a novel thermo-visco-elastic cohesive zone model based on fractional calculus. Temperature and relative displacements along the domains where moisture diffusion takes place are then projected to the finite element model of diffusion, coupled with the thermo-mechanical problem by the temperature and crack opening dependent diffusion coefficient. The application of the proposed method to photovoltaic modules pinpoints two important physical aspects: (i) moisture diffusion in humidity freeze tests with a temperature dependent diffusivity is a much slower process than in the case of a constant diffusion coefficient; (ii) channel cracks through Silicon solar cells significantly enhance moisture diffusion and electric degradation, as confirmed by experimental tests.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a new 3D continuous-discontinuous heat conduction model to consider the thermal resistance effect of cracks and dynamic crack propagation during heat transfer. Combining this heat conduction model and the finite-discrete element method (FDEM), we construct a coupled thermomechanical model for solving thermal cracking problems in brittle materials. The mechanical fracture calculation utilizes virtual joint elements between adjacent solid elements for fracture simulation. On the other hand, virtual joint elements are not included in the heat conduction model to improve numerical efficiency. When new cracks are generated, the node sharing relationship is dynamically updated in the heat conduction calculation to consider the thermal resistance effect of cracks. In this study, the proposed models are verified by simulating heat transfer, coupled thermomechanical, and thermal cracking problems in brittle materials. The numerical simulations are consistent with analytical solutions, and a complex thermal crack process can be realistically captured. These numerical examples verify the correctness of the proposed models, which can be powerful tools for solving heat transfer, coupled thermomechanical, and thermal cracking problems in brittle materials.},

	abstract = {Epidermal electronic devices (EEDs) are very attractive in applications of monitoring human vital signs for diagnostic, therapeutic, or surgical functions due to their ability for integration with human skin. Thermomechanical analysis is critical for EEDs in these applications since excessive heating-induced temperature increase and stress may cause discomfort. An axisymmetric analytical thermomechanical model based on the transfer matrix method, accounting for the coupling between the Fourier heat conduction in the EED and the bio-heat transfer in human skin, the multilayer feature of human skin and the size effect of the heating component in EEDs, is established to study the thermomechanical behavior of the EED/skin system. The predictions of the temperature increase and principle stress from the analytical model agree well with those from finite element analysis (FEA). The influences of various geometric parameters and material properties of the substrate on the maximum principle stress are fully investigated to provide design guidelines for avoiding the adverse thermal effects. The thermal and mechanical comfort analyses are then performed based on the analytical model. These results establish the theoretical foundation for thermomechanical analysis of the EED/skin system.},

The introduced coupled thermomechanical functional extends the classical strain energy function proposed by Ogden. Volume changes due to thermal expansion are regarded for a large temperature domain and play a remarkable role in thermoelastic materials. The non-linear thermoelastic problem is solved within a staggered (fractional-step) method which is based on a two-phase (isentropic) operator split. Each of the two symmetric sub-problems retains the characteristic dissipative structure of the implicit monolithic scheme which consequently results to an unconditionally stable product formula algorithm. The numerical analysis side shows in particular the capability of the theoretical framework reproducing the realistic physical stress-deformation-temperature relations of rubber. Distinctive attention is paid to the thermoelastic inversion phenomena, a remarkable property governing the class of rubber-like materials.},

In our computations, the Krylov deferred correction (KDC) method, a pseudo-spectral type time-marching technique, is introduced to perform temporal discretization in time-domain. The KDC method allows discretizing the temporal direction using relatively large time-steps, making the method very promising for dynamic simulations, particularly when high precision is desired. A multi-domain GFDM scheme is also employed where the composite material considered is decomposed into several sub-domains and, in each sub-domain, the solution is approximated by using the GFDM expansion. On the sub-domain interface, compatibility of temperatures and normal heat fluxes is imposed. The method is tested on several benchmark numerical examples and its relative merits and disadvantages are discussed.},

However, the implication of the basic postulates and the significance of the related procedure for the development of the constitutive equations is also illustrated in some detail in the context of flow of heat in a rigid solid with particular reference to the propagation of thermal waves at finite speed. More specifically, after briefly examining the nature of the basic equations of motion for a system of particles within the scope of the classical newtonian mechanics, the basic postulates of the purely mechanical theory for a continuum (including its specialization for a rigid body) is re-examined. This includes some differences from the usual procedure on the subject. Next, thermal variables are introduced and after observing a useful analogy between the thermal and mechanical variables, a discussion of a theory of heat (or a purely thermal theory) is provided which differs from the usual development in the classical thermodynamics. A detailed application of the latter development is then made to the problem of heat flow in a stationary rigid solid using several different and well-motivated constitutive equations. Special cases of these include linearized theories of the classical heat flow by conduction and of heat flow transmitted as thermal waves. The remainder of the paper is concerned with thermal mechanical theory of deformable media along with discussions of a number of related issues on the subject.},

Although routine thermomechanical problems are primarily influenced by classical effects, issues where non-classical influences may become important are also addressed. To date, numerous applications ranging from defense, aerospace to manufacturing related problems including routine mechanical, civil, nuclear and allied engineering applications influenced by thermal-structural interactions continue to pose significant challenges both from the underlying mechanics and from a computational viewpoint. Herein is first presented an overview of non-classical and classical dynamic thermoelasticity models and equations governing these situations. Subsequently, attention is focused on computational approaches for the modeling and analysis of various classes of problems encompassing thermal-structural interactions which can be broadly classified as: i) thermally-induced stress wave propagation problems, ii) thermally-induced dynamic (inertial type) problems, and iii) the general field of thermal stresses. A variety of illustrative numerical examples encompassing non-classical and classical influences are finally presented to provide an improved understanding of the behavior of thermal-structural problems via effective unified computational developments.

	abstract = {Mechanobiological interactions are essential for the adaption of the cardiovascular system to altered environmental and internal conditions, but are poorly understood with regard to abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) pathogenesis, growth and rupture. In the present study, we therefore calculated mechanical AAA quantities using nonlinear finite element methods and correlated these to [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-metabolic activity in the AAA wall detected by positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). The interplay between mechanics and FDG-metabolic activity was analyzed in terms of maximum values and the three-dimensional spatial relationship, respectively. Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) data sets of n = 18 AAA patients were studied. Maximum FDG-uptake (SUV max ) in the AAA wall varied from 1.32 to 4.60 (average SUV max 3.31 {\textpm} 0.87). Maximum wall stresses and strains ranged from 10.0 to 64.0 N/cm(2) (38.2 {\textpm} 13.8  N/cm(2)) and from 0.190 to 0.260 (0.222 {\textpm} 0.023), respectively. SUV max was significantly correlated to maximum wall stress and strain (SUV max to stress: r = 0.71, p = 0.0005; SUV max to strain: r = 0.66, p = 0.0013). To evaluate the three-dimensional spatial interaction between FDG-uptake and acting wall stress, element-wise correlations were performed. In all but 2 AAAs, positive element-wise correlation of FDG-uptake to wall stress was obtained, with the Pearson's correlation coefficient ranging from -0.168 to 0.738 ( 0.372 {\textpm} 0.263). The results indicate that mechanical stresses are correlated quantitatively and spatially to FDG-uptake in the AAA wall. It is hypothesized that unphysiologically increased loading in the AAA wall triggers biological tissue reaction, such as inflammation or regenerative processes, causing elevated FDG-metabolic activity. These findings strongly support experimental hypotheses of mechanotransduction mechanisms in vivo.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a complete formulation of a model of coupled associative thermoplasticity at finite strains, addresses in detail the numerical analysis aspects involved in its finite element implementation, and assesses the performance of the proposed mechanical and finite element models in a comprehensive set of numerical simulations. On the thermomechanical side, novel aspects of the proposed model of thermoplasticity are (1) the explicit characterization of the plastic (configurational) entropy as an independent internal variable, (2) a thermomechanical extension of the principle of maximum dissipation consistent with the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient, and (3) the exploitation of this extended principle in the formulation of an associative flow which characterizes the evolution of the plastic entropy in terms of the change of the flow criterion with respect to temperature. On the numerical analysis side, salient features of the proposed approach are (4) a new global product formula algorithm constructed via an operator split of the nonlinear initial value problem, which leads to a two-step solution procedure, (5) a unified class of local return mapping algorithms which preserves exactly the incompressibility constraint on the plastic flow and reduces to the classical radial return method for isothermal J2-flow theory, and (6) the formulation of a mixed finite element method in terms of the elastic entropy and the temperature field which circumvents well-known difficulties associated with the incompressibility constraint on the plastic flow. The exact linearization of both the product formula algorithm and an alternative simulataneous solution scheme for the coupled thermomechanical problem is given in two appendices.},

Its key components are a fluid time-integrator that is provably second-order time-accurate on moving grids, the midpoint rule for advancing in time the solution of the structural dynamics equations of motion, a second-order structure predictor for bypassing the inner-iterations encountered in strongly-coupled solution procedures, and a carefully designed algorithm for time-integrating the motion of the fluid-mesh. Following this methodology, two different loosely-coupled schemes are constructed for the solution of transient nonlinear FSI problems and proved to be second-order time-accurate. Three-dimensional numerical results pertaining to the simulation of the aeroelastic response to a gravity excitation of a complete F-16 configuration are also presented. In addition to confirming the theoretical results discussed in this paper, these numerical results highlight a very stable behavior of the designed loosely-coupled partitioned procedures.},

In the explicit{\textendash}explicit case where the usually desirable simultaneous updating of the fluid and structural states is both natural and trivial, staggering is shown to improve numerical stability. Using rigorous ALE extensions of the two-stage explicit Runge{\textendash}Kutta and three-point backward difference methods for the fluid, and in both cases the explicit central difference scheme for the structure, second-order time-accuracy is achieved for the coupled explicit{\textendash}explicit and implicit{\textendash}explicit fluid{\textendash}structure time-integration methods, respectively, via suitable predictors and careful stagings of the computational steps. The robustness of both methods and their proven second-order time-accuracy are verified for sample application problems. Their potential for the solution of highly non-linear fluid{\textendash}structure interaction problems is demonstrated and validated with the simulation of the dynamic collapse of a cylindrical shell submerged in water. The obtained numerical results demonstrate that, even for fluid{\textendash}structure applications with strong added mass effects, a carefully designed staggered and subiteration-free time-integrator can achieve numerical stability and robustness with respect to the slenderness of the structure, as long as the fluid is justifiably modeled as a compressible medium.

The model is based on a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient in elastic and plastic parts, together with an additive elastoplastic decomposition of the fluid content. The final relations describing the evolution of the different fields are then obtained in the thermodynamic framework furnished by the principle of maximum plastic dissipation. The particular case of an associated Drucker-Prager model in effective stresses is considered as a model example. A complete characterization of the dissipative structure of the problem of evolution is described through the derivation of an a priori stability estimate. We describe in detail the finite element implementation of the model in the context of staggered algorithms for the solution of the physically coupled problem. Finally, we present representative numerical simulations to illustrate the features of the proposed models. In particular, the case of strain localization in globally undrained conditions is studied in the proposed framework.},

Such an implementation is herein called a staggered solution strategy. The conventional realization of this strategy is handicapped, however, by severe temporal stepsize limitations. Several stabilized formulations are introduced, which circumvent such limitations and achieve unconditional stability for certain extrapolators.

The paper describes the partitioning process for certain discrete-element equations of motion, as well as the associated computer implementation. It then delineates the procedure for designing a partitioned analysis method in a given application. Finally, examples are presented to illustrate the concepts.

Large-scale calculation of the coupled fault zone process is often inhibited by the high-order interpolation of the displacement field required to overcome unstable tendencies of the finite elements in the incompressible and nearly incompressible limit. In this work we utilize a stabilized formulation in which the balance of mass is augmented with an additional term representing a stabilization to the incremental change in the pressure field. The stabilized formulation permits equal-order interpolation for the displacement and pore pressure fields and suppresses pore pressure oscillations in the incompressible and nearly incompressible limit. The technique is implemented with a recently developed critical state plasticity model to investigate transient fluid-flow/solid-deformation processes arising from slip weakening of a fault segment. The accompanying transient pore pressure development and dissipation can be used to predict fault rupture and directivity where fluid flow is an important driving force.},

	abstract = {A mathematical model for finite strain elastoplastic consolidation of fully saturated soil media is implemented into a finite element program. The algorithmic treatment of finite strain elastoplasticity for the solid phase is based on multiplicative decomposition and is coupled with the algorithm for fluid flow via the Kirchhoff pore water pressure. A two-field mixed finite element formulation is employed in which the nodal solid displacements and the nodal pore water pressures are coupled via the linear momentum and mass balance equations. The constitutive model for the solid phase is represented by modified Cam{\textemdash}Clay theory formulated in the Kirchhoff principal stress space, and return mapping is carried out in the strain space defined by the invariants of the elastic logarithmic principal stretches. The constitutive model for fluid flow is represented by a generalized Darcy's law formulated with respect to the current configuration. The finite element model is fully amenable to exact linearization. Numerical examples with and without finite deformation effects are presented to demonstrate the impact of geometric nonlinearity on the predicted responses. The paper concludes with an assessment of the performance of the finite element consolidation model with respect to accuracy and numerical stability.},

The physical model is restricted to Biot{\textquoteright}s theory of single-phase flow and linear poroelasticity, but is sufficiently general to be extended to multiphase flow problems and inelastic behavior. The distinctive technical aspects of our approach are: (1) the space discretization of the equations. The unknown variables are the pressure, the fluid velocity, and the rock displacements. We recognize that these variables are of very different nature, and need to be discretized differently. We propose a mixed finite element space discretization, which is stable, convergent, locally mass conservative, and employs a single computational grid. To ensure stability and robustness, we perform an implicit time integration of the fluid flow equations. (2) The strategies for the solution of the coupled system. We compare different solution strategies, including the fully coupled approach, the usual (conditionally stable) iteratively coupled approach, and a less common unconditionally stable sequential scheme. We show that the latter scheme corresponds to a modified block Jacobi method, which also enjoys improved convergence properties. This computational model has been implemented in an object-oriented reservoir simulator, whose modular design allows for further extensions and enhancements. We show several representative numerical simulations that illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.},

	abstract = {Fluid{\textendash}structure interaction (FSI) problems are of great relevance to many fields in engineering and applied sciences. One wide spread and complex FSI-subclass is the category that studies the instationary behavior of incompressible viscous flows and thin-walled structures exhibiting large deformations. Free surfaces often present an essential additional challenge for this class of problems. Prominent application areas are fluid sloshing in tanks and numerable problems in offshore engineering and naval architecture. Especially when partitioned strong coupling schemes are used in order to solve the coupled FSI problem the design of an appropriate overall computational approach including free surface effects is not trivial. In this paper a new so-called partitioned implicit free surface approach is introduced and embedded into a strong coupling FSI solver. For complex problem classes this approach is combined with the general elevation equation that is closed through a dimensionally reduced pseudo-structural approach. The presented approach shows the same stability properties as a full implicit approach but is by far more efficient{\textemdash}especially in the partitioned coupled case.},

This paper proposes to overcome these problems by considering the fluid and the structure as a unique continuous medium, to be studied in a fixed reference configuration. The resulting problem is then split into a fluid and a structural part through an additive decomposition of the space of kinematically admissible test functions. This approach treats the structure in a fully Lagrangian way and uses an associated arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) formulation for the fluid. Such a strategy has three advantages which are detailed in the present paper. {\textbullet} it can be discretised in time by implicit, stable, energy conserving time integration schemes, and solved by simple, iterative uncoupled algorithms; {\textbullet} the fluid and the structural problems can be approximated by independent finite element spaces; {\textbullet} the most recent geometrically exact nonlinear shell models can be used for the structures. The full strategy has been implemented into an industrial CFD code. Results obtained in the simulation of industrial hydraulic shock absorbers are presented at the end of the paper.},

All theoretical results are derived for a one-dimensional piston model problem with a compressible flow, because the complete three-dimensional aeroelastic problem is difficult to analyze mathematically. However, the insight gained from the analysis of the coupled piston problem and the conclusions drawn from its numerical investigation are confirmed with the numerical simulation of the two-dimensional transient aeroelastic response of a flexible panel in a transonic non-linear Euler flow regime.},

We present a mathematical framework for assessing some important numerical properties of the chosen partitioned procedure, and predicting its performance for realistic applications. Our analysis framework is based on the estimation of the energy that is artificially introduced at the fluid/structure interface by the staggering process that is inherent to most partitioned solution methods. This framework also suggests alternative approaches for time-discretizing the transfer of aerodynamic data from the fluid subsystem to the structure subsystem that improves the accuracy and the stability properties of the underlying partitioned method. We apply this framework to the analysis of several partitioned procedures that have been previously proposed for the solution of nonlinear transient aeroelastic problems. Using two- and three-dimensional, transonic and supersonic, wing and panel aeroelastic applications, we validate this framework and highlight its impact on the design and selection of a staggering algorithm for the solution of coupled fluid/structure equations.},

We show that if these schemes are simply coupled and used straightforwardly with subcycling, then accuracy and stability properties may be lost. We present new coupling staggered procedures where momentum conservation is enforced at the interface. This is done by using a structural predictor. Continuity of structural and fluid grid displacements is not satisfied at the fluid/structure interface. However, we show on a two-degree-of-freedom aerofoil that this new type of method has many advantages, e.g. accuracy of conservation at the interface and extended stability.

	abstract = {Numerical simulation of fluid{\textendash}structure interactions has typically been done using partitioned solution methods. However, partitioned methods are inherently non-conservative and generally numerically unstable. The deficiencies of partitioned methods have motivated the investigation of monolithic solution methods. Conservation is possible for monolithic methods, the conditions have recently been presented [E.H. van Brummelen, S.J. Hulshoff, R. de Borst, Energy conservation under incompatibility for fluid{\textendash}structure interaction problems, Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg. 192 (2003) 2727{\textendash}2748]. In the present paper we investigate the relevance of maintaining conservation for a model fluid{\textendash}structure interaction problem, viz., the piston problem. To distinguish the effect of the error induced by the interface coupling from the fluid and structure discretization errors, we use fluid subcycling and an exact time-integration method for the structure. A comparison between conservative and non-conservative monolithic methods as well as partitioned methods is made. We show that maintaining conservation has considerable impact on the stability and accuracy of the numerical method. These results also indicate that only for a conservative monolithic scheme the improvement in accuracy over partitioned methods warrants the computational cost associated with a monolithic solution. Moreover, we illustrate the implications that particular combinations of fluid and structure discretizations can have on the conservation properties of the fluid{\textendash}structure interaction problem.},

The development of reusable hypersonic cruise vehicles requires analysis capability that can capture the coupled, highly-nonlinear interactions between the fluid flow, structural mechanics, and structural heat transfer. This coupled analysis must also be performed over significant portions of the flight trajectory due to the long-term thermal evolution of the vehicle. The fluid and structural physics operate at significantly smaller time scales than the thermal evolution, requiring time marching that can capture the small time scales for time records that encapsulate the longer time scale of the thermal response. This leads to extreme computational times and motivates research that seeks to maximize efficiency of the time integrations for the coupled problem. The goal of this dissertation is to develop time integration procedures that significantly improve computational efficiency while also maintaining time accuracy},

	abstract = {We analyze stability and convergence of sequential implicit methods for coupled flow and geomechanics, in which the flow problem is solved first. We employ the von Neumann and energy methods for linear and nonlinear problems, respectively. We consider two sequential methods with the generalized midpoint rule for tn+$\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is the parameter of time discretization: namely, the fixed-strain and fixed-stress splits. The von Neumann method indicates that the fixed-strain split is only conditionally stable, and that its stability limit is a coupling strength less than unity if $\alpha$ ? 0.5. On the other hand, the fixed-stress split is unconditionally stable when $\alpha$ ? 0.5, the amplification factors of the fixed-stress split are different from those of the undrained split and are identical to the fully coupled method. Unconditional stability of the fixed-stress split is also obtained from the energy method for poroelastoplasticity. We show that the fixed-stress split is contractive and B-stable when $\alpha$ ? 0.5. We also estimate the convergence behaviors for the two sequential methods by the matrix based and spectral analyses for the backward Euler method in time. From the estimates, the fixed-strain split may not be convergent with a fixed number of iterations particularly around the stability limit even though it is stable. The fixed-stress split, however, is convergent for a fixed number of iterations, showing better accuracy than the undrained split. Even when we cannot obtain the exact local bulk modulus (or exact rock compressibility) at the flow step a priori due to complex boundary conditions or the nonlinearity of the materials, the fixed-stress split can still provide stability and convergence by an appropriate estimation of the local bulk modulus, such as the dimension-based estimation, by which the employed local bulk modulus is less stiff than the exact local bulk modulus. We provide numerical examples supporting all the estimates of stability and convergence for the fixed-strain and fixed-stress splits.},

	abstract = {Abstract Numerical simulation of fluid{\textendash}structure interaction is often attempted in the context of partitioned methods, where already existing solvers for fluid or structure alone are used jointly. Mostly this is done by exchanging information from time step to time step in an alternating fashion. These weak coupling methods are explicit and hence suffer from possible instabilities. Therefore often strong coupling{\textendash}{\textendash}where equilibrium is satisfied jointly between fluid and structure in each time step{\textendash}{\textendash}is desired; the simplest computational procedure is similar to the time stepping an alternating iteration. We show why also this approach may experience difficulties, and how they may be circumvented with block-Newton methods, still in the partitioned framework, by only using the solvers of the subproblems fluid and structure.},

	abstract = {Abstract We perform a stability and convergence analysis of sequential methods for coupled flow and geomechanics, in which the mechanics sub-problem is solved first. We consider slow deformations, so that inertia is negligible and the mechanical problem is governed by an elliptic equation. We use Biot{\textquoteright}s self-consistent theory to obtain the classical parabolic-type flow problem. We use a generalized midpoint rule (parameter $\alpha$ between 0 and 1) time discretization, and consider two classical sequential methods: the drained and undrained splits. The von Neumann method provides sharp stability estimates for the linear poroelasticity problem. The drained split with backward Euler time discretization ( $\alpha$ = 1) is conditionally stable, and its stability depends only on the coupling strength, and it is independent of time step size. The drained split with the midpoint rule ( $\alpha$ = 0.5) is unconditionally unstable. The mixed time discretization, with $\alpha$ = 1.0 for mechanics and $\alpha$ = 0.5 for flow, has the same stability properties as the backward Euler scheme. The von Neumann method indicates that the undrained split is unconditionally stable when $\alpha$ ? 0.5. We extend the stability analysis to the nonlinear regime (poro-elastoplasticity) via the energy method. It is well known that the drained split does not inherit the contractivity property of the continuum problem, thereby precluding unconditional stability. For the undrained split we show that it is B-stable (therefore unconditionally stable at the algorithmic level) when $\alpha$ ? 0.5. We also analyze convergence of the drained and undrained splits, and derive the a priori error estimates from matrix algebra and spectral analysis. We show that the drained split with a fixed number of iterations is not convergent even when it is stable. The undrained split with a fixed number of iterations is convergent for a compressible system (i.e., finite Biot modulus). For a nearly-incompressible system (i.e., very large Biot modulus), the undrained split loses first-order accuracy, and becomes non-convergent in time. We also study the rate of convergence of both splits when they are used in a fully-iterated sequential scheme. When the medium permeability is high or the time step size is large, which corresponds to a high diffusion of pressure, the error amplification of the drained split is lower and therefore converges faster than the undrained split. The situation is reversed in the case of low permeability and small time step size. We provide numerical experiments supporting all the stability and convergence estimates of the drained and undrained splits, in the linear and nonlinear regimes. We also show that our spatial discretization (finite volumes for flow and finite elements for mechanics) removes the well-documented spurious instability in consolidation problems at early times.},

A novel feature of the present algorithm is a flexibility normalization along the partitioned boundary nodes by using a localized version of the method of Lagrange multipliers, thus making the algorithm insensitive to both material and kinematic heterogeneities among the partitioned substructures.

	abstract = {Abstract We present a method with domain decomposition to solve time-dependent non-linear problems. This method enables arbitrary numeric schemes of the Newmark family to be coupled with different time steps in each subdomain: this coupling is achieved by prescribing continuity of velocities at the interface. We are more specifically interested in the coupling of implicit/explicit numeric schemes taking into account material and geometric non-linearities. The interfaces are modelled using a dual Schur formulation where the Lagrange multipliers represent the interfacial forces. Unlike the continuous formulation, the discretized formulation of the dynamic problem is unable to verify simultaneously the continuity of displacements, velocities and accelerations at the interfaces. We show that, within the framework of the Newmark family of numeric schemes, continuity of velocities at the interfaces enables the definition of an algorithm which is stable for all cases envisaged. To prove this stability, we use an energy method, i.e. a global method over the whole time interval, in order to verify the algorithms properties. Then, we propose to extend this to non-linear situations in the following cases: implicit linear/explicit non-linear, explicit non-linear/explicit non-linear and implicit non-linear/explicit non-linear. Finally, we present some examples showing the feasibility of the method. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Various multifield problems and among them fluid-structure interaction applications arise in nearly all fields of engineering. The present work contributes to the development of a stable and robust approach for the numerical simulation of fluid-structure interaction problems. In particular two-dimensional and three-dimensional elastic structues interacting with incompressible flow are considered. The structural field is governed by the nonlinear elastodynamic equations while the dynamics of the fluid field are described by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Both fields are discretised by finite elements in space and finite difference methods in time. An iteratively staggered partitioned coupling procedure with relaxation is applied to obtain the overall coupled solution. This work focuses on methodological aspects and contributes to a deeper understanding of the theoretical foundations of the approach. This is necessary to ensure that the formulation is stable and offers reliable results for a wide range of parameters. In particular the flow solver formulated in an arbitrary Lagrangean Eulerian approach is considered. In addition to the classical conservation laws of mass, linear momentum and energy geometric conservation has to be considered. This is a consequence of the formulation of the flow equations with respect to a moving frame of reference. The relationship of these conservation laws and the stability of the numerical scheme is investigated and stability limits in terms of maximal time step sizes for different formulations are established. It is further shown how an unconditionally stable ALE formulation has to be constructed. Another key issue is the stabilised finite element method employed on the fluid domain. The derivation of the method from a virtual bubble approach is revisited while special attention is turned to the fact that the domain is moving. A version of the stabilisation is derived which is nearly unaffected by the motion of the frame of reference. Further the sensitivity of the stabilised formulation with respect to critical parameters such as very small time steps, steep gradients and distorted meshes is assessed. At least for higher order elements where full consistency of the formulation is assured very accurate results can be obtained on highly distorted meshes. As another main issue the coupling of fluid and structure within a partitioned scheme is considered. A first concern in this context is the exchange of proper coupling data at the interface which is crucial for the consistency of the overall scheme. Subsequently the so-called artificial added mass effect is analysed. This effect is responsible for an inherent instability of sequentially staggered coupling schemes applied to the coupling of lightweight structures and incompressible flow. It is essentially the influence of the incompressibilty which excludes the successful use of simple staggered schemes. The analysis derived in the course of this work reveals why the artificial added mass instability depends upon the mass ratio but further on the specific time discretisation used on the fluid and structural field. In particular it is shown why more accurate temporal discretisation results in an earlier onset of the instability. While the theoretical considerations are accompanied by small numerical examples highlighting particular aspects some larger applications of the method are finally presented. In nahezu allen Bereichen des Ingenieurwesens treten Mehrfeldprobleme auf, zu denen auch Fluid-Struktur-Interaktionen (FSI) zu zahlen sind. Diese Arbeit tragt zur Entwicklung eines stabilen und robusten numerischen Verfahrens zur Losung solcher FSI-Probleme bei. Hier werden speziell zwei- und dreidimensionale Strukturen betrachtet, die in Wechselwirkung mit inkompressiblen Flussigkeiten treten. Dabei ist das Strukturverhalten durch die nichtlinearen Gleichungen der Elastodynamik bestimmt. Die Dynamik des Fluids wird durch die inkompressiblen Navier-Stokes-Gleichungen beschrieben. Beide Felder werden mit Hilfe finiter Elemente im Raum und mittels Differenzenverfahren in der Zeit diskretisiert. Um das gekoppelte Problem zu losen, kommt ein iterativ gestaffeltes partitioniertes Kopplungsverfahren mit Relaxation zum Einsatz. Der Schwerpunkt dieser Arbeit liegt auf methodischen Aspekten. Insbesondere sollen die theoretischen Grundlagen des numerischen Verfahrens verbessert werden. Dabei ist das Ziel sicherzustellen, das das Verfahren stabil lauft und fur einen weiten Parameterbereich Ergebnisse von verlaslicher Genauigkeit liefert. Besondere Aufmerksamkeit gilt dem Fluidloser, der in "Arbitrary Lagrangean Eulerian" (ALE) Betrachtungsweise formuliert ist. Das Verhalten des Fluids wird also in Bezug auf ein bewegtes Koordinatensystem beschrieben. Daher gilt es hier, neben den klassischen Erhaltungssatzen fur Masse, Impuls und Energie auch die geometrische Erhalung zu beachten. Der Zusammenhang zwischen den verschiedenen Erhaltungssatzen und der Stabilitat des numerischen Verfahrens wird untersucht und es konnen Stabilitatsgrenzen in Form von maximalen Zeitschrittweiten fur verschiedene Verfahren angegeben werden. Weiterhin kann gezeigt werden, wie ein unbedingt stabiles ALE Verfahren formuliert werden mus . Ein nachstes Schwerpunktthema ist das stabilisierte Finite-Element-Verfahren auf dem bewegten Gebiet. Es wird eine Version des Stabilisierungsverfahrens hergeleitet, deren Stabilitat von der Netzbewegung nahezu unberuhrt bleibt. Weitere Untersuchungen betreffen die Empfindlichkeit des Verfahrens in Bezug auf kritische Parameter wie sehr kleine Zeitschritte, steile Gradienten oder auch stark verzerrte Netze. Fur Elemente hoherer Ordnung ist das stabilisierte Verfahren vollstandig konsistent. Es wird gezeigt, das mit solchen Elementen auch auf deutlich verzerrten Nezten sehr genaue Ergebnisse erzielt werden konnen. Besonderes Augenmerk wird auch auf die Fluid-Struktur-Kopplung im Rahmen partitionierter Verfahren gelegt. In diesem Zusammenhang betrifft eine erste Frage den Austausch genauer und methodisch konsistenter Kopplungsinformation an der Grenzflache zwischen Fluid und Struktur. Weiterhin wird der sogenannte "artificial added mass effect" analysiert. Dieser Effekt bezeichnet die inherente Instabilitat, die bei sequentiell gestaffelten Verfahren auftritt, wenn leichte Strukturen mit inkompressiblen Fluiden gekoppelt werden. Dabei ist letztendlich die Inkompressibilitat dafur verantwortlich, das einfache sequentiell gestaffelte Verfahren nicht erfolgreich verwendet werden konnen. Die mathematische Analyse, die im Rahmen dieser Arbeit vorgenommen wird, zeigt, warum die Instabilitat nicht nur vom Massenverhaltnis der beteiligten Kontinua, sondern auch von der Zeitdiskretisierung der Felder abhangt. Es wird deutlich, warum genauere zeitliche Diskretisierungsansatze ein fruheres Eintreten der Instabilitat zur Folge haben. Die theoretischen Ergebnisse werden durch begleitende kleine Beispielrechnungen veranschaulicht. Einige grosere Anwendungen des Verfahrens werden am Schlus der Arbeit prasentiert.},

We discuss the latest advances in the computational algorithms associated with this approach for modeling aeroelastic problems. We apply the three-field nonlinear computational framework to the prediction of the aeroelastic frequencies and damping coefficients of an F-16 configuration in various subsonic, transonic, and supersonic regimes. We consider for this purpose both the popular two-dimensional typical wing section model and a detailed three-dimensional FE model of the structure, and compare in both cases the obtained numerical results with flight test data. We comment on the advantages and shortfalls of both approaches, and on the feasibility as well as the merit of the three-field formulation of nonlinear aeroelasticity for the extraction of flutter envelopes.},

Previous research has shown that the number of coupling iterations increases when the time step decreases or when the structure becomes more flexible which is explained here by Fourier error analysis of the unsteady, incompressible flow in an elastic tube. Substituting a linearized model of the structural solver into the flow solver makes the coupling more stable but is impracticable if the flow solver is a black box. Therefore the coupling iterations are stabilized by coupling with reduced-order models and Aitken underrelaxation.},

It is also shown how the same combinations of parameters lead, in the case of strongly coupled schemes, to problems that demand a greater computational effort to be solved, requiring for example a high number of subiterations. The application that we have in mind is FSI simulation for blood flow in large human arteries, but the discussion applies as well to several FSI problems in which an incompressible fluid interacts with a thin elastic structure. To carry out the mathematical analysis, we consider a simplified model representing the interaction between a potential fluid and a linear elastic thin tube. Despite its simplicity, this model reproduces propagation phenomena and takes into account the added-mass effect of the fluid on the structure, which is known to be source of numerical difficulties. This allows to draw conclusions that apply to more realistic problems, as well.},

However, the discrete meshes used in the different domains do not have to match at their common interface, especially when different physical fields are involved such as in fluid{\textendash}structure interaction computations. Exchange of information over this interface is therefore no longer trivial. In this paper six methods that can deal with the information transfer between non-matching meshes in fluid{\textendash}structure interaction computations are compared for different criteria. This is done for analytical test cases as well as a quasi-1D fluid{\textendash}structure interaction problem. Two methods based on radial basis functions, one with compact support and one using thin plate splines, are favoured over the other methods because of their high accuracy and efficiency.},

The experimental results showed that the compression strength, stiffness, and specific energy absorption increased with the decrease in temperature and with the increase in strain rate. It also showed that, the compressive damage morphologies were sensitive to the change in temperature and strain rate. A coupled thermal-mechanical numerical analysis was conducted to find the thermo/mechanical coupling effect on the compressive crashworthiness of the three-dimensional composite tube. The temperature distributions in the braided preform and the resin during the impact compression were also calculated through finite element analysis. From the finite element analysis results, the inelastic heat generation was seen to be more in the preform than the matrix and its distribution and accumulation led to the damage progress along the loading direction.},

These include physics-based methods, such as SIMPLE, and purely algebraic preconditioners based on the approximation of the Schur complement. All these techniques can be represented as approximate block factorization (ABF) type preconditioners. The goal is to decompose the application of the preconditioner into simplified sub-systems in which scalable multi-level type solvers can be applied. In this paper we develop a taxonomy of these ideas based on an adaptation of a generalized approximate factorization of the Navier{\textendash}Stokes system first presented in [A. Quarteroni, F. Saleri, A. Veneziani, Factorization methods for the numerical approximation of Navier{\textendash}Stokes equations, Computational Methods in Applied Mechanical Engineering 188 (2000) 505{\textendash}526]. This taxonomy illuminates the similarities and differences among these preconditioners and the central role played by efficient approximation of certain Schur complement operators. We then present a parallel computational study that examines the performance of these methods and compares them to an additive Schwarz domain decomposition (DD) algorithm. Results are presented for two and three-dimensional steady state problems for enclosed domains and inflow/outflow systems on both structured and unstructured meshes. The numerical experiments are performed using MPSalsa, a stabilized finite element code.},

	abstract = {For various engineering applications, the analysis and prediction of damage onset and propagation within ductile materials under thermo-mechanical loading conditions play a crucial role. However, finite element modeling of the influence of the temperature on plastic flow and damage evolution and the back-coupling of theses dissipative processes on the temperature field remains a challenging task, until today. To this end, a thermo-mechanically coupled two-surface damage-plasticity theory is derived in a thermodynamically consistent manner for large deformations. It can be considered as the thermo-mechanically coupled extension of a corresponding isothermal model, which was proposed recently by Brepols et~al. (2020). In this novel theory, the heat generation associated with thermo-elastic coupling and irreversible processes (i.e. damage and plasticity) is derived from the first law of thermodynamics. To overcome the mesh-dependence of conventional local damage models, a gradient-extension based on the micromorphic approach of Forest (2009, 2016) is employed. Besides the theoretical development, the algorithmic implementation into finite elements is discussed, including the computation of the required tangent operators via automatic differentiation. Finally, the fully coupled multi-physical formulation is verified regarding mesh-insensitive predictions of e.g. strain localization, local heat accumulation, material and thermal-softening, as well as crack propagation and back-coupling effects on the temperature field. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons of the model{\textquoteright}s predictions to experimental data reveal the promising potential of the numerically robust and flexible theory.},

The discussion considers the implementation of a stabilized FE formulation in context of a fully-implicit time integration and direct-to-steady-state solution capability. The nonlinear solver strategy employs Newton{\textendash}Krylov methods, which are preconditioned using fully-coupled algebraic multilevel preconditioners. These preconditioners are shown to enable a robust, scalable and efficient solution approach for the large-scale sparse linear systems generated by the Newton linearization. Verification results demonstrate the expected order-of-accuracy for the stabilized FE discretization. The approach is tested on a variety of prototype problems, including both low-Lundquist number (e.g., an MHD Faraday conduction pump and a hydromagnetic Rayleigh{\textendash}Bernard linear stability calculation) and moderately-high Lundquist number (magnetic island coalescence problem) examples. Initial results that explore the scaling of the solution methods are presented on up to 4096 processors for problems with up to 64M unknowns on a CrayXT3/4. Additionally, a large-scale proof-of-capability calculation for 1 billion unknowns for the MHD Faraday pump problem on 24,000 cores is presented.},

	abstract = {Abstract This study considers the performance of a fully coupled algebraic multilevel preconditioner for Newton{\textendash}Krylov solution methods. The performance of the preconditioner is demonstrated on a set of challenging multiphysics partial differential equation (PDE) applications: a drift-diffusion approximation for semiconductor devices; a low Mach number formulation for the simulation of coupled flow, transport and non-equilibrium chemical reactions; and a low Mach number formulation for visco-resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) systems. These systems contain multiple physical mechanisms that are strongly coupled, highly nonlinear, non-symmetric and produce solutions with multiple length- and time-scales. In the context of this study the governing PDEs for these systems are discretized in space by a stabilized finite element (FE) method that collocates all unknowns at each node of the FE mesh. The algebraic multilevel preconditioner is based on an aggressive-coarsening graph-partitioning of the non-zero block structure of the Jacobian matrix. The performance of the algebraic multilevel preconditioner is compared with a standard variable overlap additive Schwarz domain decomposition preconditioner. Representative performance and parallel scaling results are presented for a set of direct-to-steady-state and fully implicit transient solutions. The performance studies include parallel weak scaling studies on up to 4096 cores and also includes the solution of systems as large as two billion unknowns carried out on 24000 cores of a Cray XT3/4. In general, the results of this study indicate that on this reasonably diverse set of challenging multiphysics applications the algebraic multilevel preconditioner performs very well.

	abstract = {A computational homogenization framework is developed in the context of the thermomechanical contact of two boundary layers with microscopically rough surfaces. The major goal is to accurately capture the temperature jump across the macroscopic interface in the finite deformation regime with finite deviations from the equilibrium temperature. Motivated by the limit of scale separation, a two-phase thermomechanically decoupled methodology is introduced, wherein a purely mechanical contact problem is followed by a purely thermal one. In order to correctly take into account finite size effects that are inherent to the problem, this algorithmically consistent two-phase framework is cast within a self-consistent iterative scheme that acts as a first-order corrector. For a comparison with alternative coupled homogenization frameworks as well as for numerical validation, a mortar-based thermomechanical contact algorithm is introduced. This algorithm is uniformly applicable to all orders of isogeometric discretizations through non-uniform rational B-spline basis functions. Overall, the two-phase approach combined with the mortar contact algorithm delivers a computational framework of optimal efficiency that can accurately represent the geometry of smooth surface textures.

The overall homogenization framework transfers macroscopic contact variables, such as surfacial stretch, pressure and heat flux, as boundary conditions on a test sample within a micromechanical interface testing procedure. An analysis of the thermal dissipation within the test sample reveals a thermodynamically consistent identification for the macroscopic thermal contact conductance parameter that enables the solution of a homogenized thermomechanical contact boundary value problem based on standard computational approaches. The homogenized contact response effectively predicts a temperature jump across the macroscale contact interface. The strong dependence of this homogenized response on macroscale solution variables of interest is demonstrated via representative three-dimensional numerical investigations. The proposed contact homogenization framework is suitable for the analysis of similar energy transport phenomena across heterogeneous contact interfaces where the investigation of the sources for energy dissipation is of concern.

To this end, a micro{\textendash}macro mechanical dissipation equality is first established which enables defining a macroscopic frictional traction. The derivation allows both contacting bodies to be deformable, thereby extending the commonly adopted setting where one of the bodies is rigid. Moreover, it forms a basis for the second step, where a novel micro{\textendash}macro thermal dissipation equality is established which enables defining partitioning coefficients that are associated with the frictional dissipation as it is perceived on the macroscale. Finally, a comparison of the temperature fields from the original heterogeneous thermomechanical contact problem and an idealized homogeneous one reveals an identification of the macroscopic temperature jump. The computational implementation of the framework is carried out within an incrementally two-phase micromechanical test which delivers a well-defined macroscopic response that is not influenced by purely algorithmic choices such as the duration of sliding. Two-dimensional numerical investigations on periodic and random samples from thermo-viscoelastic boundary layers with unilateral and bilateral roughness demonstrate the temperature{\textendash}velocity{\textendash}pressure dependence of the macroscopic contact response.},

	abstract = {Fluid-structure interaction refers to the mutual interaction between a fluid flow and a deforming structure. This phenomenon occurs due to the blood flow in our arteries and also during the inflation of a balloon. To simulate fluid-structure interaction problems, both flow equations and the structural equations have to be solved. Partitioned techniques solve the flow equations and the structural equations separately by coupling a flow solver with a structural solver. However, as the governing equations are solved separately, the stresses and displacements on the fluid-structure interface are not automatically in equilibrium. Therefore, coupling iterations between the flow solver and the structural solver have to be performed in each time step of the partitioned simulation if the interaction between the flow and the structure is strong. In this research, the stability of a simple coupling algorithm has been investigated to gain insight into the difficulties of partitioned fluid-structure interaction simulations. Furthermore, existing and more complex algorithms have been compared and several new algorithms have been developed. Most of these algorithms do not require knowledge or more modification of the internals of the flow solver and the structural solver. Finally, fluid-structure interaction problems involving free surface flow have been solved.},
